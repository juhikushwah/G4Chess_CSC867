# G4Chess_CSC867

A chess web application which allows two users to create and play the class board game in real-time.

This project was a part of the course CSC 667/867- Internet Application Design and Development, at San Francisco State University. I completed this project with:-

1. Adam Tremarche: https://github.com/atremarc
2. Jesus Garnica: https://github.com/MrAppleII
3. Gem Angelo Lagman: https://github.com/gemlagman
4. Aashutosh Bajgain: https://github.com/aashutosh19

**Technologies used:** MERN stack, axios, socket.io for real-time interaction between users and AWS Ubuntu server for hosting.

Our gameplay is handled by a javascript package Chess.js and our gameboard display is handled by Chessboard.jsx.

Look at the documentation PDF for more information.
